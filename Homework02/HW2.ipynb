    "\n",
    "1. Gradient ascent is a technique used when we want to maximize a function, meaning we aim to find a local maximum. On the other hand, gradient descent is its opposite—it's used to minimize a function, helping us find a local minimum. In machine learning, gradient ascent is particularly useful in cases like maximizing the log-likelihood in probabilistic models or optimizing reward functions in reinforcement learning tasks.\n",
    "2. Interestingly, gradient descent can achieve the same result if we rewrite the problem as minimizing the negative of the function. This works because minimizing \n",

    "(\n",

    "−f(x) essentially follows the same path as maximizing \n",
    "𝑓\n",
    "(\n",
    "𝑥\n",
    ")\n",
    "f(x), leading to the same solution in the end.\n",
    "3. The learning rate (alpha) and the number of iterations are key factors in optimization. A higher learning rate can speed things up but might overshoot the optimal solution, causing instability, while a very small learning rate ensures stability but makes progress much slower and risks getting stuck in less-than-ideal solutions. Similarly, increasing the number of iterations gives the algorithm more opportunities to find the best solution, but after a certain point, the improvements become minimal. In some cases, too many iterations can even lead to overfitting. For example, running a gradient ascent algorithm with different learning rates, like 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0, and varying iterations, such as 50, 100, or 500, shows that a small learning rate gives stable but slow results, while a very high one might cause the process to diverge or oscillate. The number of iterations helps refine the solution, but after a certain point, the changes in the outcome are barely noticeable.\n",
    "4. When data isn’t normalized, features with larger values can overpower smaller ones, leading to uneven parameter updates and a distorted or less effective decision boundary. Normalizing the data levels the playing field, ensuring all features contribute equally and allowing the algorithm to learn more effectively. Without normalization, the optimization process can become slower, less stable, and more likely to get stuck in local optima, ultimately harming the model’s ability to generalize to new data. Testing the algorithm with and without normalization clearly shows the difference, with unnormalized data often resulting in poorer performance, unstable outcomes, and slower progress.\n",

    "**WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The evolution of decision boundaries across polynomial degrees shows a clear progression in complexity and fitting capability. The linear boundary demonstrates significant limitations, creating straight lines that fail to capture the natural separation between classes. Moving to quadratic boundaries marks a substantial improvement, as the curved lines better adapt to the data's natural distribution. The cubic boundary introduces even more complex curves, though this added complexity might exceed what's necessary for effective classification, so increasing the polynomial degree will not lead to underfitting, but instead to overfitting. The accuracy plot demonstrates that the model's performance improves significantly from degree 1 to 2, but then stabilizes, suggesting that increasing polynomial degree beyond this point doesn't yield meaningful improvements. This indicates that degree 2 provides an optimal balance between model complexity and performance for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The relationship between training and test accuracy provides valuable insights into model behavior. After degree 2, the test accuracy stabilizes around 85%, while training accuracy maintains a consistently lower level around 80%. This stable gap between training and test performance shows the classic pattern where training accuracy exceeds test accuracy, indicating that while the model learns from the training data, it maintains reasonable generalization without severe overfitting. Having a very complex decision boundary (high polynomial degree) is generally undesirable for several reasons: it increases computational complexity, risks overfitting the data, doesn't provide significant performance improvements, and potentially reduces the model's generalization capability. The evidence suggests that simpler models, particularly those using quadratic features, achieve optimal performance while maintaining good generalization ability. The stability of both training and test accuracy after degree 2-3 further supports this conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Several dataset characteristics can make a dataset particularly susceptible to overfitting. Limited dataset size makes it difficult for models to distinguish between genuine patterns and random noise. High noise levels in the data can cause models to fit irrelevant variations rather than true underlying patterns. High dimensionality relative to the number of samples increases the risk of finding spurious correlations. Class imbalance can lead to biased model behavior, while outliers can force models to create unnecessarily complex decision boundaries to accommodate these extreme points. Sparse data regions can lead to unreliable boundary decisions due to insufficient information. In the given dataset, we can observe several of these characteristics: overlapping classes, presence of outliers, varying data density across different regions, and noticeable noise in the distribution. These properties explain why a moderate complexity model (quadratic) performs well enough, and why increasing complexity further doesn't provide substantial benefits. This scenario illustrates the importance of matching model complexity to the inherent structure and challenges present in the data.\n",

    "1. What happens when we use a non-penalized logistic regression?\n",
    "2. Observe the plot of the Train and Validation losses in the penalized vs non penalized case. In which case is the Train loss better? Can you explain why?\n",

    "**WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When we use a non-penalized logistic regression, the loss computed on the validation set is higher than in the penalized cases. This is due to **overfitting**, as the non-penalized model is free to assign large weights to features, even if they are noisy or less informative. While this reduces the training loss, it makes the model less generalizable to unseen data, leading to higher validation loss.\n",
    "2. The **train loss** is lower in the non-penalized logistic regression compared to the penalized case. This happens because the penalization (L2 regularization) adds a constraint that discourages large weights, which slightly sacrifices training accuracy. However, the penalized logistic regression achieves better validation loss because regularization reduces overfitting, helping the model generalize better to unseen data. This trade-off demonstrates the benefit of regularization in achieving a balance between fitting the training data and maintaining simplicity for better generalization.\n",
    "3.  The **convergence rate** of the algorithm is slightly slower in the penalized logistic regression compared to the non-penalized case. This is because the gradient update rule in the penalized model includes an additional term ($\\lambda \\theta $) to account for the regularization penalty, which adjusts the weights more conservatively. Higher values of $ \\lambda $ further slow down convergence since the penalty term dominates the gradient. However, the slower convergence is often a worthwhile trade-off as it prevents the model from overfitting and leads to better validation performance.\n",

A degree of 2 tends to perform better than a degree of 4 across most combinations of hyperparameters.The best configuration in terms of mean_accuracy is polynomial gregree in 2, neighbors in 7, and weights = distance or uniform (both achieve mean_accuracy = 0.72).\n",
    "3. In general, lower polynomial degrees (simpler transformations) appear to generalize better. Also, increasing neighbors (n) tends to improve accuracy, suggesting that considering more neighbors provides more stable predictions for this dataset. However, the distance weighting scheme slightly outperforms uniform, particularly for higher n_neighbors.\n",
    "4. Given the train accuracy in 0.7578 and validation accuracy in 0.7317. The model performs better on the training set, suggesting potential overfitting. And, overfitting usually suggests that the model performs slightly worse on unseen data due to complexity or limited generalization.\n",
    "5. A higher degree increases the number of features and model complexity, leading to higher computation time.As seen in the plot, results for degree 4 (darker points) generally show lower or comparable accuracy to degree 2, despite the higher computational cost. In summary, There is a strong relation between higher polynomial degrees and larger n_neighbors that increase computational costs, but the improvement in accuracy depends on the configuration. Based on the results, degree at 2 with 7 neighbors  and weights equals to distance achieves a good balance between accuracy and compute power.\n",

    "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class imbalance can introduce different challenges when training a ML model, including some of the following:\n",
    "   - **Bias toward the majority class**: The model may become biased toward predicting the majority class because it sees far more examples of this class during training, which can lead to a worse performance on the minority class.\n",
    "   - **Reduced generalization**: The model may fail to generalize well to underrepresented classes, as it may not learn enough distinguishing features for these classes.\n",
    "   - **Evaluation metrics distortion**: Performance metrics like accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets, as the model could achieve high accuracy simply by predicting the majority class most of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some common strategies to address class imbalance are:\n",
    "   - **Oversampling**: This involves increasing the number of samples in the minority class. This can be done by either duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic data\n",
    "   - **Undersampling**: This method reduces the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset. However, one downside is that it may result in the loss of important data, potentially affecting model performance.\n",
    "   - **Class Weights**: By adjusting the loss function, we can give higher penalties to misclassifications of the minority class. This helps the model pay more attention to the underrepresented classes during training.\n",
    "   - **Ensemble Methods**: Techniques like random forests or boosting algorithms are effective when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as they combine multiple models to improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Accuracy can be a misleading metric because it doesn't account for the differences in performance between the majority and minority classes. In the case of an imbalanced dataset, if the model predominantly predicts the majority class, it could still report high accuracy, even if it fails to classify the minority class properly. For example, in a dataset where 95% of the samples belong to one class, a model that always predicts the majority class would achieve 95% accuracy, despite not addressing the minority class at all. Therefore, to have a clearer perspective of the model's effectiveness, metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score are more informative, as they better reflect performance, particularly for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The CIFAR-10 dataset is fairly balanced compared to many other datasets when it comes to the number of samples per class. It contains 10 different classes, with each class having 6,000 images in total (5,000 for training and 1,000 for testing). The distribution of samples is quite even across all classes, which means that there is no significant class imbalance in CIFAR-10. To verify this, we can visualize the number of samples in each class of the CIFAR-10 dataset by plotting them:\n",
