# FDS Homeworks

This repository contains homework assignments as part of the **Sapienza's Fundamentals of Data Science** course. The assignments are focused on various data science techniques and methodologies, ranging from image processing to classification and advanced deep learning applications.

## Homework 1: Image Filtering and Object Identification

**Objective:**  
Explore image processing techniques, including image filtering, edge detection, multi-scale image representations, and object identification.  

**Tasks:**  
- Apply 1D and 2D filters to images.  
- Perform edge detection using Prewitt and Canny operators.  
- Detect corners using the Harris Corner Detector.  
- Build Gaussian pyramids and analyze aliasing.  
- Identify objects using histograms and evaluate their performance.  

This assignment focuses on implementing image processing techniques and analyzing their performance for tasks like image retrieval and object identification.

## Homework 2: Classification  

**Objective:**  
Implement classification models for binary and multi-class problems and explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve prediction accuracy.  

**Tasks:**  
- Implement Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent.  
- Extend logistic regression with polynomial features and apply regularization.  
- Develop a multinomial classification pipeline using the Softmax Regression Model.  
- Build and evaluate a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
- Experiment with custom and pre-trained models to improve accuracy.
- 
This assignment emphasizes both traditional machine learning techniques and an introduction to deep learning concepts.
